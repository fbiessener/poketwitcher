# PokeTwitcher Project

An application that allows users to treat Pokémon Go as a birdwatching experience. Users can view and add sightings of Pokemon (restricted to currently available pokémon in Pokemon Go) to their Pokédex. This app was built using a Python/Flask backend and PostgreSQL database.
